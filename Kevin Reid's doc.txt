Kevin Reid's Custom Mac OS X Keyboard Layout
============================================

I designed the first version of this keyboard layout to make it convenient to program in Lisp, by giving unshifted ( ) : | characters. I then added features useful for typing mathematics in plain text.

It is based on the Mac OS X system default “U.S.” keyboard layout.

To install a keyboard layout on Mac OS X, place it in
    ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts
or
    /Library/Keyboard Layouts
Changes will not be visible until the next time you log in.

Table of symbols
----------------

“Standard” means that the mapping is in the default U.S. layout; they are mentioned here only because I have explicitly _kept_ them as being of interest. Any key combination not mentioned here gives the same result as in the default U.S. layout.

“Dead” means that the key is a “dead key”, one which must be followed by another key (combination) to type a specific character.

Ordinary/shift key:
Swapped [] and (), swapped : and ;, swapped | and \.

Option key:
3 × times symbol
4 ¢ cents symbol (Standard)
9 · center dot symbol (usually shifted)
0 ‚ low-9 quotation mark (usually shifted)
d ∂ partial derivative symbol (Standard)
t þ Thorn (lowercase)
h θ Theta (lowercase) -- TODO: Decide if having theta on Greek is good enough
j ∆ U+2206 Increment (Standard - capital delta operator symbol)
a Dead: Arrows
    WASD are directions, QEZC are diagonals, RF are double arrows
    Shift doubles the bar.
s Dead: Set symbols
    u ∪ Union
    i ∩ Intersection
    e ∈ Element of
    0 ∅ Empty set
    , ⊂ Subset   (Chosen to be like <)
    . ⊃ Superset
k Dead: Greek keyboard
    Same as system Greek layout.
    Note that Option-w is summation sign ∑ whereas Option-k Shift-s is capital sigma Σ.
l Dead: Logical symbols
    A ∀ For all
    E ∃ There exists
    a ∨ Or
    e ∧ And
    q ≡ Equivalence
    o ⇔ Biconditional
    i ∈ Element of
    Option-i ∉ Not element of
    n ¬ Logical not 
x ≈ Proportional to (Standard)
v √ Square root sign (Standard)
b ∫ Integral sign (Standard)
m µ mu sign (Standard)
[ ‘ left curly quote (Moved compared to standard)
] ’ right curly quote (Unshifted compared to standard)

Option-Shift:
` ∝ Proportional-to symbol
6 Dead: superscripts and subscripts
    Superscripts supported: 1243567890-=+()in
    Press Option to access subscripts.
    Subscripts supported: 1234567890-=+()aeox
    TODO: There are more (not a lot more) subscripts available in Unicode.
t Þ Thorn (uppercase)
f ′ Prime
g ″ Double prime
h † Dagger
j ∇ Nabla (inverted delta)
l λ Lambda
x ∼ Tilde operator (centered tilde)
Option-Shift-accent dead keys type _combining_ characters, except for `:
  a right arrow
  e acute accent
  y ẋ combining dot above
  u ẍ combining diaeresis
  i x̂ combining circumflex accent
  n x̃ combining tilde
  , x̅ combining overline
  . x̌ combining caron
[ “ left double curly quote
] ” right double curly quote (Unshifted and moved, compared to standard)

Characters to be added in future versions
-----------------------------------------

⌘ Command symbol
⌥ Option symbol
‽ Interrobang
− Minus sign
‐ Hyphen
ɥ Turned h
ǝ Turned e
║ Double vertical
✓ Check mark
⊥ Up tack / perpendicular symbol
⊢ Right tack / turnstile / entails
∘ "Ring operator" as opposed to degree symbol
◆ Black diamond
▸ Right small triangle (used in TI-89)
■ Black square (used in TI-89)
␣ Open box (used to denote space)
